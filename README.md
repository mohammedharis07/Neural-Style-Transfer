Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch

This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) using PyTorch to blend the artistic style of one image with the content of another image. NST is achieved by optimizing the generated image to minimize the content loss (similarity to content image) and style loss (similarity to style image).

ðŸ“œ Project Overview

Content Image: The image whose content will be preserved.

Style Image: The image from which the artistic style will be extracted.

Output Image: A new image generated by combining the content of the content image with the style of the style image.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

Python 3.10+

PyTorch

torchvision

PIL (Pillow)

Matplotlib

Tqdm (for progress bar)

ðŸ“¥ Installation

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer.git
cd neural-style-transfer

2. Install the required packages:

     pip install torch torchvision pillow matplotlib tqdm
3. Place your content and style images in the project directory.

ðŸ“Š File Structure

neural-style-transfer
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ neural_transfer.py   # Main Python code
â”œâ”€â”€ content_image.jpg    # Your content image
â”œâ”€â”€ style_image.jpg      # Your style image
â”œâ”€â”€ output.png           # Output image generated
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation

ðŸ“œ How to Use

Open the neural_transfer.py file.

Modify the content_path and style_path variables to your image paths:

content_path = r"C:\path\to\content_image.jpg"
style_path = r"C:\path\to\style_image.jpg"


Run the Python script:

python neural_transfer.py

The output image will be saved as output.png in your project directory.

ðŸ“Š Output

The script will generate an image that combines the content from your content image and the artistic style from your style image.

ðŸŽ¨ Hyperparameters

The code allows you to control the intensity of style transfer by tuning the following:

Content Weight: Controls how much content should be preserved.

Style Weight: Controls how much style should influence the output.

Learning Rate: Controls the speed of optimization.

Epochs: Number of training iterations.

These parameters can be modified in the code as:

content_weight = 1e2
style_weight = 3e9
lr = 0.05
epochs = 500
